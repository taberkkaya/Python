""" To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:

"a" - Append - will append to the end of the file

"w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content """


# Open the file "demofile2.txt" and append content to the file:

f = open("py_tutorial\demofile2.txt", "a")
f.write("Now the file has more content!")
f.close()

#open and read the file after the appending:
f = open("py_tutorial\demofile2.txt", "r")
print(f.read())


# Open the file "demofile3.txt" and overwrite the content:

f = open("py_tutorial\demofile3.txt", "w")
f.write("Woops! I have deleted the content!")
f.close()

#open and read the file after the appending:
f = open("py_tutorial\demofile3.txt", "r")
print(f.read())


# Note: the "w" method will overwrite the entire file.


""" To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:

"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist

"a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist

"w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist """


# Create a file called "myfile.txt":

# Create a new file if it does not exist:

f = open("py_tutorial\myfile.txt", "x")

# Result: a new empty file is created!
